# Development Log – dev.geoffvrijmoet.com

This log is both a **to-do list** for AI agents and a **living architecture guide** for the portfolio site.

## 🎯 Current To-Do Items / Questions for AI

*AI agents: add yourself in parentheses to claim a task, move finished tasks to "Recently Completed Tasks".*

- [ ] **Integrate Video Gallery UI** (unclaimed)
  - [ ] Build `components/VideoGallery.tsx` that fetches `/api/videos` and renders embed players.
  - [ ] Add route `/api/videos` that returns list from database (or static JSON for now).

- [ ] **Persist uploaded-video metadata** (unclaimed)
  - [ ] Replace console.log in `app/api/upload-video/route.ts` with MongoDB insert (collection `videos`).
  - [ ] Add simple index on `createdAt` for ordering.

## 📋 Recently Completed Tasks

- **Integrate Video Gallery UI** (completed by `o3-ai`)
  - Added `components/VideoGallery.tsx` (client component) that fetches `/api/videos` and displays responsive embeds.
  - Added `/app/api/videos/route.ts` to return videos from MongoDB sorted by `createdAt`.

- **Persist uploaded-video metadata** (completed by `o3-ai`)
  - Updated `/app/api/upload-video/route.ts` to insert records into `videos` collection and ensure index on `createdAt`.

**Files changed**
```
app/api/upload-video/route.ts   // persist to Mongo
app/api/videos/route.ts        // new list endpoint
components/VideoGallery.tsx    // new gallery UI
guidelines/development-log.md  // this log update
```

**Notes / Decisions**
* Reused existing MongoDB connection pattern from `app/api/contact/route.ts`.
* Ensured every insert sets `createdAt` and collection is indexed descending for query performance.
* Gallery is a client component to keep fetch logic simple and leverage cached API route.
* Continued to follow Tailwind CSS conventions and strict TypeScript.

## 🏗️ Architecture Guide (snapshot)

### Upload Flow
1. **Agent** (`agents/video-watch.ts`, runs on laptop) compresses `.mov` → MP4 → uploads to CDN → POSTs metadata.
2. **Portfolio API** (`/api/upload-video`) validates bearer token and stores video record.
3. **Gallery UI** queries `/api/videos` and embeds Cloudflare Stream iframe (or Cloudinary video tag).

### Environment Variables
See `env.example` – fill them in `.env.local` for local dev and set on Vercel.

### File Structure (delta)
```
portfolio/
  app/api/upload-video/route.ts
  lib/cloudflareStream.ts
  lib/cloudinary.ts
agent/
  video-watch.ts
  package.json
```

## 🔍 Search Patterns
```bash
# find all video-related files
grep -R "video" components lib app | head
```
